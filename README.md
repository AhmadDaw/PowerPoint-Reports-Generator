To run the code follow the steps:

1. Create the virtual environment in Python. You can name it anything, here we'll use "myenv": 
`virtualenv myenv`

2. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Linux/Mac: 
`source myenv/bin/activate` 
- On Windows:
`myenv\Scripts\activate`

4. Your command prompt will now start with `(myenv)` indicating you are in the virtual environment.

5. To recreate the environment run: 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

6. To deactivate the virtual environment, run:

- On Linux/Mac: 
`deactivate`
- On Windows: 
`deactivate.bat` 

Your command prompt will no longer have `(myenv)`
